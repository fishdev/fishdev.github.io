# fishdev website

This is my personal website, with my resume information as well as some personal stuff like public Spotify playlists.

## Development

Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). See React and CRA documentation for usage instructions. Written in [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org) and formatted using [Prettier](https://prettier.io). For styling, I'm a big fan of [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) with the [Flatly](https://jenil.github.io/bulmaswatch/flatly/) theme.

All the source is in the [dev branch](https://github.com/fishdev/fishdev.github.io/tree/dev).

## Adapting

If you really like the structure of my website, feel free to use it as a basis for your own personal website. All the content is located in the [assets directory](https://github.com/fishdev/fishdev.github.io/tree/dev/src/data). Start by changing the constants for your name and organization. You can also add blocks (projects, experiences, and skills) to the resume section.
